# Experiment 3: Shopping Cart Application (Client-Side Validation with JavaScript)

This project enhances the shopping cart application from Experiments 1 and 2 by implementing robust **client-side form validation using JavaScript**. The objective is to prevent invalid data submissions to the server, provide immediate feedback to users, and improve the overall user experience on pages such as Registration and Login.

## Features

* **Client-Side Validation**: All form inputs (e.g., username, password, email, quantities) on the Registration and Login pages are validated directly in the browser using JavaScript before submission.
* **Immediate Feedback**: Users receive instant visual cues (e.g., error messages, changing border colors) if their input does not meet the required criteria.
* **Common Validation Rules**:
    * **Required Fields**: Ensures essential fields are not left empty.
    * **Minimum/Maximum Length**: Checks string lengths for fields like username and password.
    * **Email Format**: Validates email addresses using regular expressions.
    * **Password Confirmation**: Ensures password and confirm password fields match.
    * **Numeric Input**: Validates age, quantity, etc., are valid numbers.
    * **Custom Rules**: (Optional) More specific rules as needed (e.g., username cannot contain special characters).
* **Improved User Experience**: Reduces server load and provides a smoother interaction by catching errors early.
* **Integration with Existing UI**: Validation seamlessly integrates with the CSS3/Flexbox/Grid (from Exp 1) or Bootstrap (from Exp 2) styled forms.

## Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3 (from Exp 1 or Exp 2)
* JavaScript (ES5/ES6 for validation logic)
* (Optional: Bootstrap, if integrating with Exp 2's UI)

## Setup and Running

1.  **Clone the Repository (or download the project files):**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/Experiment-03_Shopping-cart-app_validation.git](https://github.com/your-username/Experiment-03_Shopping-cart-app_validation.git)
    cd Experiment-03_Shopping-cart-app_validation
    ```
2.  **Review Dependencies (if any):**
    * Ensure the HTML files correctly link to the JavaScript validation file.
    * If building on Experiment 2, ensure Bootstrap CSS/JS are still linked.
3.  **Open in Browser:**
    * Navigate to the project directory.
    * Open `registration.html` or `login.html` (the pages containing forms for validation) in your preferred web browser.
    * **No server is required** as this is a purely frontend application.
