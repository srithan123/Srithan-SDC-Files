# Experiment 1: Responsive Shopping Cart Application (CSS3, Flexbox, Grid)

This project focuses on building the foundational frontend of a responsive web application for an e-commerce shopping cart. The application includes essential pages like Registration, Login, Product Catalog, and Shopping Cart. The primary objective is to demonstrate proficiency in modern CSS3 features, particularly **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid**, to achieve a responsive and adaptable layout across various screen sizes.

## Features
![alt text](images/open.png)
* **Registration Page**: Allows new users to sign up.
* **Login Page**: Enables existing users to log in.
* **Product Catalog Page**: Displays a list of products, showcasing item details.
* **Shopping Cart Page**: Manages items added to the cart, displaying quantities and totals.
* **Responsive Design**: The layout dynamically adjusts for optimal viewing on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
* **Modern CSS3 Layouts**:
    * Utilizes **CSS Flexbox** for one-dimensional alignment and distribution of items (e.g., navigation bars, form elements, product cards within a row).
    * Utilizes **CSS Grid** for two-dimensional layout structures (e.g., overall page layout, complex catalog grids).
* **Semantic HTML5**: Uses appropriate HTML5 elements for better structure and accessibility.
